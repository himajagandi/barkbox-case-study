**Author:** Himaja Gandi  
**Role:** Product Manager (Capstone)  
**Objective:** Improve month 1 retention from 75% to 80% by introducing personalization during signup.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

BarkBox faces a challenge where 25% of new users churn after the first box. Feedback suggests dogs don't enjoy the toys/treats received, pointing to a mismatch in product-dog fit.

---

## 🧠 Hypothesis

If we personalize the box contents based on dog preferences collected during signup, customers will perceive higher value, increasing retention and satisfaction.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Increase Month 1 Retention: 75% → 80%  
- Boost NPS: 25 → 40  
- Cost Impact: <$3 per box increase

---

## 📋 Assumptions

- Dog owners can identify their dog's toy/treat preferences  
- Personalization increases perceived value  
- Operations can support box customization  
- Quiz data can be effectively utilized to curate boxes

---

## 🛠️ Solution Overview

- Introduce a **3-question quiz** during onboarding
- Match quiz responses to curated box combinations
- Add visual cues to help customers feel their box is uniquely tailored
- Create internal logic to map quiz types to item SKUs
